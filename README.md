The aim of this project is to create a Python module that is able to draw an animation of any image, using Fourier series. This is inspired by the Fourier series circle drawings video by 3Blue1Brown.

A particular interest on the parameters (degrees of approximation), speed of the videos would be of interest. Test and analysis on various images should be investigated. As a simple case, one would start with the constraint that the input image can be a black and white svg file. Then, adaptation to color cases and to general image format (like png, jpg, etc. ) could be added.

At the end, so we have :
